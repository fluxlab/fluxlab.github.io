        <p>Welcome to Flux. We are working to create a space for a new culture of makers/breakers/fixers and benders in Portland, Oregon. A space filled with people and tools that can help you navigate both the technical and emotional hurdles of finishing your dream projects while also being friendly and non-threatening. </p>

<p>We recognize that the technology world is often a binder full of dicks, and are working to make technology inclusive for people of all backgrounds and genders. We do our best to maintain an explicitly intersectional feminist space that welcomes members and guests of all genders, racial and cultural backgrounds, and levels of ability.</p>
