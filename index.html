        <p>Welcome to Flux. We are working to create a space for a new culture of makers/breakers/fixers and benders in Portland, Oregon. A space filled with people and tools that can help you navigate both the technical and emotional hurdles of finishing your dream projects while also being friendly and non-threatening. </p>

				<p>We recognize that the technology world is often a binder full of testosterone, and are working to make technology inclusive for people of all backgrounds and genders. We do our best to maintain an explicitly intersectional feminist space that welcomes members and guests of all genders, racial and cultural backgrounds, and levels of ability.</p>

				<p>We must make our space safe so we can be dangerous together!</p> 

				<a id="about"></a><h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>We open August 1st in downtown Portland: 412 SW Couch Unit #222</p>

				<p><strong>Hackerspace</strong>: A collaborative space where do-it-your-selfers share tools, intelligence and community. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">thousands of hackerspaces across the world</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Flux</strong>: is a hackerspace working to create a comfortable space for non-male people to make awesome stuff. All people can participate. In our hackerspace it is safe to be generous, vulnerable, and strong. We are building a source of strength to be ourselves in a community without armoring up against sexism and racism.</p>

				<a id="guidelines"></a><h1>Guidelines for respectful interaction</h1></a>
				<ol>
					<li>Be sober</li>
					<li>Be awake, go home to sleep, no one lives here.</li>
					<li>Clean up after your projects when you’re done.</li>
					<li>This is a space for making, not consuming.</li>
					<li>Treat other people as they would like to be treated. If you do not know how, ask them.</li>
					<li>Yes means yes, no means no, and maybe means no, silence is not consent. Accept “no”s without arguing, and say “yes” when you mean yes.</li>
					<li>Respect others’ personal space and possessions. Check in before you touch someone or their belongings. Don’t touch people’s hair, for example. We are not Npetting zoos.</li>
					<li>Respect chosen names/pronouns/genders, if you’re unsure ask.</li>
					<li>Act from an assumption of mutual respect and good will. Clarify misunderstandings, apologize for harm caused. Assume ignorance and not malice.</li>
					<li>Watch out for each other. Maintaining a respectful and safe community is everybody’s responsibility.</li>
					<li>If you’re not complying with these guidelines, you may be asked to leave by a Flux member.</li>
