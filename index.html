        <p>Welcome to Flux. We are working to create a space for a new culture of makers/breakers/fixers and benders in Portland, Oregon. A space filled with people and tools that can help you navigate both the technical and emotional hurdles of finishing your dream projects while also being friendly and non-threatening. </p>

				<p>We recognize that the technology world is often a binder full of testosterone, and are working to make technology inclusive for people of all backgrounds and genders. We do our best to maintain an explicitly intersectional feminist space that welcomes members and guests of all genders, racial and cultural backgrounds, and levels of ability.</p>

				<p>We must make our space safe so we can be dangerous together!</p> 

				<a id="about"></a><h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					Our space is downtown:<br />
					<strong>412 NW Couch #222</strong><br />
					<strong>Portland, OR 97209-3880</strong>
				</p>

				<p>To get in touch with the folks who have keys to the space, email <a href="mailto:info@fluxlab.io">info@fluxlab.io</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Hackerspace</strong>: A collaborative space where do-it-your-selfers share tools, intelligence and community. There are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">thousands of hackerspaces across the world</a>.</p>

				<p><strong>Flux</strong>: is a hackerspace working to create a comfortable space for non-male people to make awesome stuff. All people can participate, including male-bodied and male-identifying people. In our hackerspace it is safe to be generous, vulnerable, and strong. We are building a source of strength to be ourselves in a community without armoring up against sexism and racism.</p>

				<a id="conduct"></a><h1>Conduct Agreements</h1></a>
				<ol>
					<li>We are present, awake, and sober.</li>
					<li>We listen non-judgmentally to ourselves and to everyone else.</li>
					<li>We make mistakes: everything that happens in this space is part of a learning experience.</li>
					<li>We speak only out of and about our personal experience and understanding.</li>
					<li>When faced with a choice between being curious and being defensive, we choose to be curious.</li>
					<li>We clean up after ourselves.</li>
					<li>We make things here and consume things elsewhere.</li>
					<li>We spend some of our free time here, not most or all of it.</li>
					<li>We treat one another as <em>the other</em> would like to be treated. If we don't know how, we ask.</li>
					<li>We respect each others' personal space and possessions. Specifically, we check in before touching someone or their belongings.</li>
					<li>We respect each others' consent and boundaries. Yes means yes, no means no, maybe means no, and silence is not consent. We accept "no"s without arguing, and say "yes" when we mean yes.</li>
					<li>We respect chosen names, pronouns, and genders. If we don't know how, we ask.</li>
					<li>We act from an assumption of mutual respect and good will. We clarify misunderstandings and apologize for harm caused. We assume ignorance and not malice.</li>
					<li>We watch out for each other to maintain a respectful and safe community. If we don't know how, we ask.</li>
					<li>When people's conduct falls short of these agreements, we speak with them one-on-one. If matters don't improve, we address the issue in a small group. If matters still don't improve after three discussions, we might ask you to leave the space. As a last resort, we may vote to dissolve your membership.</li>
